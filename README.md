# Chronos

Chronos is a talking clock for visually impaired users, built with JavaScript and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io).  
Pressing a trigger on one page sends a signal via WebSocket, causing the clock page to speak the current time using the Web Speech API.

This was made as a prototype for a **school project** during **NLT technical design** lessons.
